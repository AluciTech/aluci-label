## AI Models & Tools

**Models used:** 
- Deep Research (Gemini 3)

## Areas of Involvement

### Code & Logic

* [ ] **Code Generation:** Generating initial boilerplate or small logic snippets.

* [ ] **Architecture:** Drafting software design patterns or structural diagrams.
* [ ] **Localization:** Translating comments or documentation into other languages.

### Brainstorming & Research

* [ ] **Idea Generation:** Exploring feature sets or solving specific logical hurdles.
* [X] **Research:** Summarizing technical papers or library documentation.

## Human Oversight & Ethics

* [X] **Human-in-the-loop:** All AI-generated code and content has been manually reviewed, tested, and validated by a human contributor.
* [X] **License Compliance:** We have ensured that the AI output does not violate any third-party licenses or copyright standards.
