# Aluci Label

**Aluci's label** certifies open-source projects that meet high standards in transparency, technical excellence, and human-centric design. Labeled projects are featured on the Aluci hub.

## How to Apply

Requesting the Aluci label for your project is straightforward:

1. **Review the criteria**: Read our [Labeling Criteria](CRITERIA.md) to make sure your project is ready.

3. **Submit a request**: Open a [Label Request](../../issues/new?template=label_request.yml) issue on this repository and fill out the form.
4. **Await review**: The Aluci labeling committee will evaluate your project and provide feedback.
